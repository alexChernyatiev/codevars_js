Write a function that takes a hierarchical map of properties and converts it to a single, flattened map, with the different levels separated by a forward slash ('/').

For example, given an input such as this:

{
  'a': {
    'b': {
      'c': 12,
      'd': 'Hello World'
    },
    'e': [1,2,3]
  }
}
return a new map:

{
  'a/b/c': 12,
  'a/b/d': 'Hello World',
  'a/e': [1,2,3]
}
The passed in argument will always be an object, but it may be empty. Make sure to correctly test for Arrays and nulls — they should be left as is in the result. The only property types will be:

true
false
Numbers
Strings
null
Arrays
Functions
Nested Maps
Keys can be any string of characters, excluding the '/' character.
